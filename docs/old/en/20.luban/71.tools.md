## LubanAssistant
In order to solve the problem of multi-person editing of large-scale projects and xlsx is prone to conflicts, one solution is to edit data in xlsx, but save each record as a json file that meets luban requirements. LubanAssistant can read luban table data,
Load it into excel, edit and modify it, and save it again as a json file format. This solves the difficulties of multi-person editing conflicts and merging between multiple versions.

### Install and use
1. Installation

At present, due to the certificate, the LubanAssistant plug-in can only be compiled and installed by itself. Open the src/LubanTools.sln project of this project, compile and release this plugin. Then double-click the generated LubanAssistant.vsto file to install it.
This problem will be solved later.

2. use
- Create a new xlsx file
- Switch to the "Add-ons" function page
    - Click "Set Root File" to set the path of \_\_root\_\_.xml file
    - Click "Set configuration root directory" to set configuration root directory (such as luban_examples/DesignerConfigs directory)
- Fill in the title header and comment line like a normal luban xlsx table, for example

|##| id | x | y|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|##|id|field x|field y|
- Add table= table name after A1 unit ## For example

|##table=item.TbItem| id | x | y|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|##|id|fieldx|fieldy|

- Click Load Data in the "Add-in" function page, all json files of the item.TbItem table will be loaded into the current xlsx, and now you can edit freely
- Save, support several ways
    - Save selected part of records. Select the row where the record to be saved is located, and click "Save Selected"
    - Save all. Click "Save All"

### LubanAssistant FAQ
1. Which Office versions are supported

    At present, the office 2016 version can work, and the updated version should be fine. The old version has not been tested, and it should work.

2. Does it support excel under mac?

    not support.

3. Is there any usage example

   [luban_examples](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/luban_examples) Luban_assistant_test_json.xlsx and luban_assistant_test_multi_rows.xlsx in the DesignerConfigs/Datas/test directory under the project are two examples.

4. What are the requirements for saving tables in json format?

    All that meet the requirements of the luban data source can be loaded into LubanAssistant, but when LubanAssistant saves, each record will be saved in the path specified by input with the corresponding key as the file name.

    Therefore, it is required that the input of the table must be a directory.

5. Does it support the features of ordinary luban xlsx tables such as multi-line records and sep?

    Support. All xlsx formats of common luban tables are supported.

6. Does it support loading a table into multiple sheets?

    Not support. For the time being, only the entire table can be loaded into one sheet. But you can use other techniques to achieve this effect, for example, you split the table file into several directories, create several tables grouped as e or other non-exported tables,
    The structure of these tables is exactly the same as the table you want to edit, and each table points to a split subdirectory, so that you can edit records in different directories in different sheets.

7. Do you support multiple tables in the same xlsx file?

    Support. Each sheet is independent.
