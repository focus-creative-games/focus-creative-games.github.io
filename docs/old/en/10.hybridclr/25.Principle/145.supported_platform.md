# Cross-platform support

Currently supports Win(X64, X86), Android(Arm64, Armv7), macOS(X86, X64, Arm64), iOS(Arm64), WebGL, NS 64(Nintendo)

## Win

## macOS

## Android

## iOS

## NS 64 (Nintendo)

## WebGL

WebGL is a special platform, and requires some special settings or operations before packaging.

Due to Unity, WebGL packaging does not support local il2cpp, so wolong must be installed in the global location, and set `useGlobalIl2cpp=true` in `HybridCLR Settings`

WebGL currently has a lot of packaging problems, and there are a few known ones

- IO related functions cannot be called, so you cannot preserve the entire mscorlib or preserve related classes and functions in link.xml, nor can you call related functions in the code.

If the developer finds a compilation error, remove some unsupported libraries according to the error message and try again.

It is strongly recommended to connect to HybridCLR after the packaging test is passed without HybridCLR installed, so as to avoid problems caused by being unable to distinguish whether it is WebGL or HybridCLR.

Currently, 2019 and 2020 support resource mount scripts, and 2021 has not been tested yet.
