# Updating MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject with hot

HybridCLR fully supports hot update MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject workflow. You can add runtime hot-update scripts via code `go.AddComponent<T>() or go.AddComponent(typeof(T))` without any restrictions.

You can also directly mount the hot update MonoBehaviour on the resource or use the resource corresponding to the ScriptableObject class, but there are some restrictions, which are caused by Unity's resource management system.

When the Unity resource management system deserializes the hot update script in the resource, the following conditions need to be met:

1. The dll where the script is located has been loaded into the runtime
1. It must be a resource packaged with AssetBundle (frames such as **addressable that indirectly use ab can also**)
1. The dll where the script is located must be added to the assembly list file generated during packaging. This list file is loaded when unity starts, immutable data. The list file names and formats are different for different versions of Unity.

See [Hot Update MonoBehaviour](/en/hybridclr/monobehaviour/) for detailed principles.

For beginners, you just need to remember: the resource (scene or prefab) that mounts the hot update script must be packaged into ab, and the hot update dll can be loaded before instantiating the resource (this requirement is obvious!).
