# Package

The packaging here refers to the build player, which builds a brand new game app.

Please refer to the [HybridCLR Packaging Workflow](/en/hybridclr/build_pipeline/) document for detailed principles of packaging workflow.

Before packaging, you need to do some anti-clipping link.xml generation, bridge function generation and other work, hybridclr_unity has provided a fool-like one-key operation command `HybridCLR/generate/all`.
You can run this command before packaging. Note that if you just compile the hot update dll or add the hot update dll to the hot update resource management system, you don't need to execute `HybridCLR/generate`
under the order.

The specific packaging process is as follows:

- If you use package version 1.1.0 and above, due to the adjustment of the calculation mechanism of the bridge function, the bridge function needs to be generated according to the clipping aot dll, so the following operations need to be performed additionally
   - Run `HybridCLR/generate/LinkXml`
   - Temporary packaging once in the build player (or exporting the project is also OK), to generate a cropped aot dll
- run `HybridCLR/generate/all`
- Run `HybridCLR/CompileDll/xxx` to compile the hot update dll and add it to your resource packaging system
- Pack according to the packaging method of your project
