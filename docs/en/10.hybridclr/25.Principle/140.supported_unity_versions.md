## Version Matching Rules

HybridCLR consists of two parts

1. [il2cpp_plus](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/il2cpp_plus) project

     il2cpp_plus needs to match to the **unity annual release** level

2. [HybridCLR Warehouse](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/hybridclr) HybridCLR project.

     It contains the core source code of HybridCLR, and all versions of unity share the same implementation.

e.g:

- Both 2020.3.20f1c1 and 2020.3.33f2 use the il2cpp_plus 2020.3.33 branch
- 2021.3.0f1 and 2021.3.5f1 both use the il2cpp_plus 2021.3.1 branch


We will only adapt to the LTS version, please consider upgrading to the normal version.

## Version Support Description

- If there is no special version requirement, version 2020.3.33 is recommended for optimization.
- The 2022 version has not yet been produced, and we will follow up after the first LTS version is released next year.
- 5.x - 2018 series Not supported.
