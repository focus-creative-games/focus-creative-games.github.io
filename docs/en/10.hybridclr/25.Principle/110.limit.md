# Limit

::: danger
Features that are not in the restrictions are supported by HybridCLR
Please stop asking if HybridCLR supports a certain feature.
:::

- Incremental gc is not supported yet. Due to the tight time, there is no time to carefully deal with the memory barrier details of incremental gc. This problem will be solved later.
- Temporarily does not support defining extern functions in hot update scripts, but you can call extern functions in AOT.
- Supports Unity Jobs library, but cannot take advantage of burst acceleration. If the burst part is in the AOT, it is still executed natively; if the burst part is in the hot update part, although the jobs are executed concurrently, they are executed in an interpreted manner.
- Does not support the `System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal` mechanism to serialize objects like protobuf-net, that is, functions like `Marshal.StructureToPtr` cannot work correctly. But other Marshal functions such as `Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi` can work normally.
- [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(RuntimeInitializeLoadType.xxx)] is not supported. It's purely a matter of timing. Unity collects these functions very early, before the hot update dll is loaded. Suggest another way.
